- Use TypeScript only, strict mode on.  
- Never use overlays or DOM mutation patches for accessibility.  
- Accessibility fixes must always be **code-level**.  
- Use ESLint + Prettier (Airbnb base).  
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`).  
- Each PR must include a checklist:
  • Tests pass  
  • Types clean  
  • Accessibility baseline maintained or improved  
  • WCAG criteria referenced
