# AI Chat Context & Loop Fixes

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Conversation Context Persistence** ✅
- Added `conversationHistory` to API requests
- Maintains last 10 messages to provide context
- Prevents repetitive menu responses

### 2. **Real Sorted Issue Lists** ✅
- Issues now sorted by severity (critical → serious → moderate → minor)
- Priority requests return actual data, not generic text
- Shows counts with "...and X more" for large lists

### 3. **Platform-Specific Guides** ✅
- Added `handlePlatformGuideRequest()` function
- Wired to `getPlatformGuide()` from platform-detector
- Returns contextual guides for Webflow/WordPress/Framer

### 4. **Professional Fallbacks** ✅
- First message shows summary with issue counts
- Follow-up messages avoid repeating generic menu
- Clear suggestions instead of looping back to menu

### 5. **Intent Detection & Logging** ✅
All intents now have clear console logs:
```
🎯 [AI Chat] Intent detection: { message, isFirstMessage }
✨ [AI Chat] Intent: PRIORITIES
📊 [Priority] Sorted issues: { critical: 3, serious: 5, moderate: 12 }
🔧 [Platform Guide] Generating for: { platform: 'webflow', rule: 'button-name' }
```

## 📊 **Intent Flow**

### **Supported Intents:**
1. **PRIORITIES** - "show priorities", "top issues", "what first"
2. **FIX_GUIDE** - "how do I fix", "fix this"
3. **PLATFORM_GUIDE** - "webflow guide", "wordpress steps"
4. **GITHUB** - "github issue", "create PR"
5. **EMAIL** - "email designer", "send report"
6. **CODE** - "code snippet", "show code"
7. **EXPLAIN** - "what is this", "explain", "tell me about"
8. **GREETING** (first message only)
9. **CLARIFICATION** (fallback for unrecognized)

### **3. Platform Guides Work:**
- [ ] Ask "how do I fix this in webflow?"

## 🚀 **What to Expect Now**

### **Before:**
```
User: "Show priorities"
AI: "I can help you with accessibility. Here's what I can do..." (generic menu)

User: "Show priorities"
AI: "I can help you with accessibility. Here's what I can do..." (loop!)
```

### **After:**
```
User: "Show priorities"
AI: "Here's your prioritized action plan:

🔴 Fix First (3 critical):
  1. Buttons must have discernible text
  2. Links must have discernible text
  3. Form elements must have labels

🟡 Fix Next (5 serious):
  1. Color contrast must meet WCAG AA
  ...

Recommendation: Start with critical issues..."

User: "How do I fix the first one?"
AI: "Let's fix your Buttons must have discernible text issue..."
(remembers context, doesn't repeat menu)
```
