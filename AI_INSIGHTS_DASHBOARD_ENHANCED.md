## 📊 **Smart Card Generation Logic**

### **Priority System**

Cards are shown in **priority order** based on data:

1. **Critical Alert** (if critical issues exist + unfixed) → URGENT
2. **Main Story** (if fixes made) → HERO
3. **Quick Wins** (if easy fixes available) → ACTION
4. **Time Saved** (if fixes made) → VALUE
5. **Velocity** (if fixing regularly) → MOMENTUM
6. **Top Issue** (if pattern detected) → FOCUS
7. **Forecast** (if improving trend) → PREDICTION
8. **Benchmark** (always) → CONTEXT
9. **Monitoring** (if multiple sites) → OPERATIONS

### **Dynamic Selection**

The dashboard shows **3-6 cards** based on what's most relevant:

**Scenario 1: New User (No fixes yet)**
- Quick Wins Available
- Critical Alert (if any)
- Top Issue Type
- Benchmark
- Monitoring Health

**Scenario 2: Active User (Making fixes)**
- Main Compliance Story
- Developer Time Saved
- Momentum Check
- Forecast
- Benchmark
- Quick Wins

**Scenario 3: Critical Issues**
- Immediate Action Required (top priority)
- Critical Risk Status
- Top Issue Type
- Quick Wins
- Benchmark

## 📈 **Real Data Sources**

All insights are generated from **real scan data**:

### **API Endpoints**

1. **`/api/reports/kpis`** - KPIData
   - avg_score_30d
   - total_violations_30d
   - total_sites
   - total_scans_30d

2. **`/api/reports/trend`** - TrendDataPoint[]
   - total_violations (daily)
   - critical_count
   - serious_count
   - moderate_count
   - minor_count

3. **`/api/reports/top-rules`** - TopRule[]
   - rule (WCAG ID)
   - violation_count
   - affected_sites
   - description
   - impact

### **Calculated Metrics**

```typescript
// Violations fixed (week over week)
violationsFixed = previousViolations - currentViolations

// Risk reduction (research-based weights)
riskReduction = calculateRiskReduction(prevSeverities, currentSeverities)

// Time saved (30min per fix estimate)
timeSavedHours = violationsFixed * 0.5

// Weekly fix rate (30-day average)
weeklyFixRate = totalFixesLast30d / 4.3

// Days to compliance (current pace)
daysToCompliance = currentViolations / (weeklyFixRate / 7)

// Percentile ranking (industry benchmark)
percentile = ((yourScore - industryAvg) / (topPerformer - industryAvg)) * 90 + 10
```
