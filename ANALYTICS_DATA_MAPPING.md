# Analytics Dashboard - Real Data Mapping

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Data Points Connected to Real Scan Data

## Overview

Your analytics/reports dashboard is **fully connected** to real-time data from your users' website scans. Every chart, metric, and data point pulls directly from the database through optimized SQL views.

---

## 📊 Data Architecture

### Database Views (10 Total)
All analytics data comes from PostgreSQL views that aggregate scan data:

```
scans → issues → Database Views → API Endpoints → React Hooks → UI Components
```

---

## ✅ Connected Data Points

### 1. **KPI Summary Cards** (`report_kpis_view`)

**API:** `/api/reports/kpis`  
**Hook:** `useKPIs(filters)`  
**Component:** `InteractiveKPICards`

**Real Data Shown:**
- ✅ **Total Scans (30d)**: Count of all completed scans in last 30 days
- ✅ **Total Sites**: Number of sites monitored by the team
- ✅ **Monitored Sites**: Sites with `monitoring_enabled = true`
- ✅ **Total Violations (30d)**: Sum of all violations found in last 30 days
- ✅ **Average Score (30d)**: Average compliance score across all scans
  - Formula: `(passes + inapplicable) / (passes + violations + incomplete + inapplicable) * 100`
- ✅ **GitHub Issues Created (30d)**: Count of violations exported to GitHub

**SQL Source:**
```sql
SELECT
  s.team_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sc.id) FILTER (WHERE sc.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days') as total_scans_30d,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) as total_sites,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) FILTER (WHERE s.monitoring_enabled = true) as monitored_sites,
  COALESCE(SUM(sc.total_violations) FILTER (WHERE sc.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'), 0) as total_violations_30d,
  COALESCE(AVG(...), 0) as avg_score_30d,
  COUNT(DISTINCT i.id) FILTER (WHERE i.github_issue_url IS NOT NULL ...) as github_issues_created_30d
FROM sites s
LEFT JOIN scans sc ON s.id = sc.site_id AND sc.status = 'completed'
LEFT JOIN issues i ON sc.id = i.scan_id
GROUP BY s.team_id;
```

---

### 2. **Violations Trend Chart** (`violations_trend_view`)

**API:** `/api/reports/trend`  
**Hook:** `useTrend(filters)`  
**Component:** `ViolationsTrendChart`, `ComplianceForecast`, `ForecastingChart`

**Real Data Shown:**
- ✅ **Daily Violation Counts**: Total violations per day (last 90 days)
- ✅ **Severity Breakdown by Day**:
  - Critical count
  - Serious count
  - Moderate count
  - Minor count
- ✅ **Scan Count**: Number of scans performed each day
- ✅ **Trend Lines**: Shows increase/decrease over time

**SQL Source:**
```sql
SELECT
  s.team_id,
  s.id as site_id,
  DATE(sc.created_at) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sc.id) as scan_count,
  COALESCE(SUM(sc.total_violations), 0) as total_violations,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN i.impact = 'critical' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) as critical_count,
  -- ... other severity counts
FROM sites s
LEFT JOIN scans sc ON s.id = sc.site_id AND sc.status = 'completed'
LEFT JOIN issues i ON sc.id = i.scan_id
WHERE sc.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY s.team_id, s.id, DATE(sc.created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**Used By:**
- Main violations trend chart (line chart showing daily counts)
- Compliance forecast (predicts future violations)
- AI Insights panel (analyzes trends)

---

### 3. **Fix Throughput** (`fix_throughput_view`)

**API:** `/api/reports/fixes`  
**Hook:** `useFixThroughput(filters)`  
**Component:** `RiskProjectionChart` (partially)

**Real Data Shown:**
- ✅ **Violations Fixed**: Issues that appeared in scan N but not in scan N+1
- ✅ **Violations Created**: New issues that appeared
- ✅ **Net Change**: Difference between created and fixed
- ✅ **Fix Rate Over Time**: Tracks improvement velocity

**SQL Source:**
```sql
-- Compares consecutive scans to detect fixed violations
WITH scan_pairs AS (
  -- Pairs each scan with its previous scan
  SELECT sc1.id as current_scan_id, sc2.id as previous_scan_id ...
),
current_violations AS (
  -- Count violations in current scan
  SELECT rule, impact, COUNT(*) as violation_count ...

)
SELECT
  violations_created,
  violations_fixed,
  net_change
FROM current_violations cv
LEFT JOIN previous_violations pv ON cv.rule = pv.rule
```

**Methodology:**
- A violation is considered "fixed" if it exists in scan N-1 but not in scan N
- Groups by rule and impact to track specific violation types

---

INNER JOIN issues i ON sc.id = i.scan_id
WHERE sc.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY s.team_id, i.rule, i.impact
ORDER BY violation_count DESC;
```

**Used By:**

- AI Insights (recommends which rules to prioritize)

---

### 5. **Top Pages (Sites with Most Violations)** (`top_pages_view`)

  COUNT(i.id) as total_violations,
  COUNT(i.id) FILTER (WHERE i.impact = 'critical') as critical_count,
  -- ... other counts
  ROUND(((sc.passes + sc.inapplicable) / (sc.passes + sc.total_violations + ...)) * 100, 2) as score
FROM latest_scans ls
INNER JOIN scans sc ON ls.latest_scan_id = sc.id
LEFT JOIN issues i ON sc.id = i.scan_id
GROUP BY ls.site_name, ls.url, ...
ORDER BY total_violations DESC;

### 10. **False Positives** (`false_positive_view`)

**Note:** This view intentionally returns no data (`WHERE 1=0`) until we add a `violation_status` field to track which issues are marked as false positives.

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### 1. **User Runs Scan**
```
User → Sites Page → "Run Scan" → Playwright + Axe-core → Scan Results
```

### 2. **Data Stored**
```
Scan Results → `scans` table (total_violations, passes, etc.)
              → `issues` table (rule, impact, description, selector, etc.)
```

### 3. **Views Aggregate Data**
```
`scans` + `issues` → SQL Views (daily aggregation) → Materialized results
```

### 4. **API Serves Data**
```
Frontend → `/api/reports/*` → SQL Views → JSON Response
```

### 5. **React Hooks Fetch & Cache**
```
Components → useKPIs/useTrend/etc. → Auto-refetch on filter change
```

### 6. **UI Displays Charts**
```
Hooks → Chart Components → Recharts/Custom Charts → User sees real data
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No data showing in charts"

**Check:**
1. Has the team run any scans?
2. Are scans completing successfully (`status = 'completed'`)?
3. Are violations being saved to the `issues` table?
4. Is the `teamId` correct in filters?

**Debug SQL:**
```sql
-- Check if scans exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scans WHERE team_id = 'YOUR_TEAM_ID' AND status = 'completed';

-- Check if issues exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues i
INNER JOIN scans s ON i.scan_id = s.id
WHERE s.team_id = 'YOUR_TEAM_ID';

-- Check a specific view
SELECT * FROM report_kpis_view WHERE team_id = 'YOUR_TEAM_ID';
```

### "Data seems incorrect"

**Verify:**
1. Check the `report_kpis_view` directly in Supabase
2. Compare `total_violations` in scan vs. count in issues
3. Ensure time zone settings are correct (views use UTC)
