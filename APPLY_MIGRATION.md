# Apply Deep Scan & Two-Tier System Migrations

## Quick Start

Apply both migrations in order to enable the two-tier classification system (Violations vs Advisories):

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

**Step 1: Deep Scan Schema**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/editor
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"
4. Copy/paste the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/0016_deep_scan_prototype.sql`
5. Click "Run" (bottom right)
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned" âœ…

**Step 2: Violations-Only Filtering**
1. Click "New Query" again
2. Copy/paste the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/0017_filter_violations_only.sql`
3. Click "Run" (bottom right)
4. You should see "Success. No rows returned" âœ…

### Option 2: Supabase CLI

```bash
cd /Users/ryanhofmann/auditvia
supabase db push
```

This will apply both migrations automatically.

## Verify Migration

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify all columns were added:

```sql
-- Check scans table
SELECT 
  column_name, 
  data_type,
  column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'scans' 
  AND column_name IN (
    'scan_profile', 
    'pages_scanned', 
    'states_tested', 
    'violations_count', 
    'advisories_count',
    'scan_metadata'
  )
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Check issues table  
SELECT 
  column_name, 
  data_type,
  column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'issues' 
  AND column_name IN (
    'tier', 
    'page_url', 
    'page_state', 
    'wcag_reference', 
    'requires_manual_review'
  )
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Check sites table
SELECT 
  column_name, 
  data_type,
  column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'sites' 
  AND column_name = 'default_scan_profile';
```

Expected output:
```
scans table: 6 rows (scan_profile, pages_scanned, states_tested, violations_count, advisories_count, scan_metadata)
issues table: 5 rows (tier, page_url, page_state, wcag_reference, requires_manual_review)
sites table: 1 row (default_scan_profile)
```

## What This Migration Does

### Updates to `scans` table:
- `scan_profile` - 'quick', 'standard', or 'deep'
- `pages_scanned` - Number of pages scanned (1-5)
- `states_tested` - Number of DOM states tested (1-15)
- `frames_scanned` - Number of iframes scanned (future use)
- `violations_count` - Count of WCAG violations
- `advisories_count` - Count of best-practice advisories
- `scan_metadata` - JSONB with detailed per-page results

### Updates to `issues` table:
- `tier` - 'violation' (WCAG) or 'advisory' (best practice)
- `page_url` - URL where issue was found
- `page_state` - DOM state when found (default, menu-open, etc.)
- `wcag_reference` - WCAG 2.2 criterion reference
- `requires_manual_review` - Flag for manual verification needed

### Updates to `sites` table:
- `default_scan_profile` - Default profile for new scans

### Indexes Created:
- `idx_issues_tier` - Fast filtering by violation/advisory
- `idx_issues_page_url` - Fast filtering by page

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to undo the migration:

```sql
-- Remove columns from scans
ALTER TABLE scans 
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS scan_profile,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS pages_scanned,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS states_tested,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS frames_scanned,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS violations_count,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS advisories_count,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS scan_metadata;

-- Remove columns from issues
ALTER TABLE issues
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tier,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS page_url,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS page_state,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS wcag_reference,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS requires_manual_review;

-- Remove column from sites
ALTER TABLE sites
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS default_scan_profile;

-- Drop indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_issues_tier;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_issues_page_url;
```

---

## Verify Two-Tier Classification

After applying both migrations, verify the system correctly separates violations from advisories:

```sql
-- Test tier classification
SELECT 
  tier,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  impact
FROM issues
WHERE scan_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM scans 
  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY tier, impact
ORDER BY tier, impact DESC;
```

Expected output:
```
tier        | count | impact
----------- | ----- | ----------
violation   | 45    | critical
violation   | 28    | serious
violation   | 12    | moderate
advisory    | 8     | moderate
advisory    | 5     | minor
```

**Verify compliance calculations exclude advisories:**

```sql
-- Check KPI view (should only count violations)
SELECT total_violations_30d 
FROM report_kpis_view 
WHERE team_id = 'YOUR_TEAM_ID';

-- Check risk view (should only calculate risk for violations)
SELECT 
  estimated_risk,
  critical_count,
  serious_count
FROM risk_reduced_view
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## After Migration

1. âœ… Deploy your app: `npm run build && vercel --prod`
2. âœ… Test a Deep Scan on a real site
3. âœ… Verify violations vs advisories are correctly classified
4. âœ… Check compliance score only includes violations
5. âœ… Verify risk calculations exclude advisories
6. âœ… Check analytics for events

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "column already exists"**
- This is safe to ignore - it means the column was already added
- The migration uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` for safety

**Error: "permission denied"**
- Make sure you're logged in to Supabase
- Use the SQL Editor in the dashboard (not CLI)
- Contact Supabase support if issue persists

**Error: "relation does not exist"**
- Make sure you're running on the correct database
- Check that `scans`, `issues`, and `sites` tables exist

That's it! Once the migration runs successfully, your Deep Scan v1 is fully deployed. ðŸš€
