## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Apply the migration file in Supabase:

```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/editor
# 2. Open SQL Editor
# 3. Copy/paste contents of: supabase/migrations/0016_deep_scan_prototype.sql
# 4. Click "Run"

# Option B: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check scans table has new columns
SELECT 
  column_name, 
  data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'scans' 
  AND column_name IN (
    'scan_profile', 
    'pages_scanned', 
    'states_tested', 
    'violations_count', 
    'advisories_count'
  );

-- Check issues table has new columns
SELECT 
  column_name, 
  data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'issues' 
  AND column_name IN (
    'tier', 
    'page_url', 
    'page_state', 
    'wcag_reference', 
    'requires_manual_review'
  );
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run deploy  # or your deployment command

# Or if using Vercel:
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test Deep Scan

1. **Navigate to a site in your dashboard**
2. **Click "Run Scan"** → Profile selector modal appears
3. **Choose "Deep"** → Scan starts
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** → Scan completes
5. **Check Report Page:**
   - Should show "5 Pages Scanned, 15 States Tested"
   - Should show separate Violations and Advisories counts
   - Should see "Show Advisories" toggle
6. **Click an issue:**
   - Should show "Found on: /about → menu open" (if applicable)
7. **Toggle "Show Advisories":**
   - Advisories should appear/disappear
   - Violation count stays the same

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed! Deep Scan works out of the box.

### Feature Flags (Optional)
If you want to gradually roll out:

```typescript
// In your .env.local (optional)
DEEP_SCAN_ENABLED=true  // Default: true
DEEP_SCAN_MAX_PAGES=5   // Default: 5
DEEP_SCAN_MAX_STATES=3  // Default: 3
DEEP_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS=180000  // Default: 3 minutes
```

## 🎯 User Messaging

### In Settings:
```
Choose your scan depth:

• Quick: Scans homepage only (fastest, ~30s)
• Standard: Scans top 3 pages with common interactions (~1-2min) [RECOMMENDED]
• Deep: Comprehensive scan of 5 pages across multiple states (~2-3min)

Deep scans find 3-5× more issues by testing menus, modals, and multiple 
pages. Only WCAG violations affect your compliance score.
```

### On Report:
```
💡 Your scan found 45 violations and 15 advisories.

Violations are definitive WCAG failures that affect compliance.
Advisories are best-practice recommendations for manual review.

Some scanners count advisories as "errors" - that's why our numbers 
may look different. We separate them for transparency.
```

### In Profile Modal:
```
Choose Scan Depth

Select how comprehensive this scan should be

[Quick]    1 page, 1 state    ~30s
[Standard] 3 pages, 2 states  ~1-2min  ← Default
[Deep]     5 pages, 3 states  ~2-3min

💡 Deep scans find 3-5× more issues by testing menus, modals, and multiple pages
```

## 📈 Analytics Events

The following events are now tracked:

### Scan Events
- `deep_scan_started` - When a Deep Scan begins
  - Properties: `scanId`, `siteId`, `userId`, `profile`, `url`, `timestamp`
  
- `deep_scan_completed` - When a Deep Scan finishes
  - Properties: `scanId`, `siteId`, `userId`, `profile`, `pagesScanned`, `statesAudited`, `violationsFound`, `advisoriesFound`, `totalIssues`, `duration`

### User Interaction Events
- `experience_mode_changed` - When user toggles Founder/Developer mode
- `issue_opened` - When user clicks on an issue
- `report_viewed` - When user views a scan report
- `report_viewed_v2` - Enhanced report view event with full verdict data

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Column 'scan_profile' does not exist"
**Solution:** Run the migration (Step 1)

### Issue: Scans always show "Quick" even when selecting "Deep"
**Solution:** 
1. Check that migration ran successfully
2. Verify API is receiving `scanProfile` parameter (check browser Network tab)
3. Check server logs for errors

### Issue: Advisory toggle doesn't filter issues
**Solution:** 
1. Verify issues have `tier` column populated
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure `showAdvisories` state is toggling correctly

### Issue: Deep Scan takes too long (>3 minutes)
**Solution:**
1. Check if site has many pages (crawler might be finding too many)
2. Verify timeout is set correctly in API (`SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS`)
3. Consider adjusting `maxPages` in scan profile config

### Issue: "Found on" doesn't show in issue details
**Solution:**
1. Verify issues have `page_url` and `page_state` populated
2. Check that `siteUrl` prop is passed to `IssueDetailPanel`
3. Ensure condition logic is correct (should only show if different from root)

## 📝 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Not included in v1, but planned for Phase 2:

1. **Authenticated Scans** - Login flows before scanning
2. **Parallel Page Scanning** - Scan multiple pages simultaneously
3. **Smart Component Detection** - Better recognition of custom UI patterns
4. **Visual Regression** - Screenshot comparison for UI changes
5. **Cross-Origin Resources** - Scan external assets and iframes
6. **Configurable Risk Weights** - Enterprise customers set their own risk values
7. **Scheduled Deep Scans** - Run Deep Scans on a schedule
8. **Scan Comparison** - Compare two scans to see what changed
