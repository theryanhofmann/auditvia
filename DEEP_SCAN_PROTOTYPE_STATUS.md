# Deep Scan v1 Prototype - Current Status

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/0016_deep_scan_prototype.sql`)
- Added `scan_profile` column to scans table (quick/standard/deep)
- Added metadata columns: `pages_scanned`, `states_tested`, `frames_scanned`
- Added tier counts: `violations_count`, `advisories_count`
- Added `scan_metadata` JSONB for per-page results
- Extended issues table with:
  - `tier` (violation/advisory)
  - `page_url` (which page the issue was found on)
  - `page_state` (default, menu-open, etc.)
  - `wcag_reference` (1.4.3, 2.1.1, etc.)
  - `requires_manual_review` flag
- Added `default_scan_profile` to sites table

### 2. Multi-Page Crawler (`scripts/crawler/pageCrawler.ts`)
- Discovers up to 5 pages per site (configurable by profile)
- Breadth-first search starting from homepage
- Same-origin only (security)
- Prioritizes important pages (/about, /pricing, /features, etc.)
- Respects max depth and max pages limits
- Profile configs:
  - **Quick**: 1 page, depth 0
  - **Standard**: 3 pages, depth 1
  - **Deep**: 5 pages, depth 2

### 3. Multi-State Interaction Script (`scripts/scanner/stateInteractions.ts`)
- Tests 1-4 states per page based on profile
- State sequence:
  1. **Default** (always tested)
  2. **Cookie banner dismissed** (Standard + Deep)
  3. **Primary navigation opened** (Deep only)
  4. **First interactive component** (Deep only - modal/accordion/tab)
- Smart detection of common UI patterns
- Graceful degradation (continues if state change fails)
- Returns success/failure for each state

### 4. Tier Classification System (`scripts/scanner/issueTiers.ts`)
- **Tier A (Violations)**: WCAG 2.2 A/AA/AAA definitive failures
  - 40+ violation rules classified
  - Each mapped to WCAG reference (e.g., 1.4.3, 4.1.2)
  - Includes severity level (A, AA, AAA)
- **Tier B (Advisories)**: Best practices & manual review items
  - 15+ advisory rules classified
  - Heading hierarchy, landmarks, skip links
  - Form label quality, focus order
- `classifyIssue(ruleId)` â†’ Returns tier classification
- `summarizeByTier(issues)` â†’ Returns violation vs advisory counts

### 5. Deep Scan Orchestrator (`scripts/runDeepScan.ts`)
- Integrates crawler + state testing + tier classification
- Full scan workflow:
  1. Crawl pages (up to 5)
  2. For each page: test states
  3. For each state: run axe-core
  4. Classify each issue by tier
  5. Deduplicate across states
  6. Aggregate results
- Returns comprehensive `DeepScanResult`:
  - Per-page results with state breakdown
  - Violation vs advisory counts
  - Time metrics
  - Platform detection
- Deduplication by `rule + selector + pageURL` (ignores state)

## ðŸš§ Still To Do (Next Steps)

### 6. API Integration
**File**: `src/app/api/audit/route.ts`

```typescript
// Need to:
// 1. Accept scan_profile parameter
// 2. Call runDeepScan() instead of runA11yScan()
// 3. Store enhanced results in database
// 4. Populate new columns (pages_scanned, states_tested, etc.)
// 5. Store per-page results in scan_metadata JSONB
// 6. Store issues with tier, page_url, page_state, wcag_reference
```

### 7. UI Components
Need to create/update:

#### A. Scan Profile Selector
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/sites/[siteId]/settings/ScanProfileSettings.tsx`
```tsx
<select value={scanProfile} onChange={...}>
  <option value="quick">Quick (1 page, 1 state)</option>
  <option value="standard">Standard (3 pages, 2 states)</option>
  <option value="deep">Deep (5 pages, 3 states)</option>
</select>
```

#### B. Enhanced Scan Summary
**File**: `src/app/components/report/DeepScanSummary.tsx`
```tsx
// Show:
// - Pages scanned: 5
// - States tested: 12
// - Violations: 45
// - Advisories: 23 (with tooltip explaining difference)
```

#### C. Violation vs Advisory Breakdown
**File**: `src/app/components/report/TierBreakdown.tsx`
```tsx
// Stacked bar or donut chart showing:
// - Violations (red) vs Advisories (yellow)
// - Click to filter by tier
```

#### D. Issue Detail Updates
**File**: `src/app/components/report/IssueDetailPanel.tsx`
```tsx
// Add:
// - Tier badge (Violation/Advisory)
// - "Found on: /pricing â†’ menu open"
// - WCAG reference link (if violation)
// - Manual review flag (if advisory)
```

### 8. Telemetry Events
**File**: Add to existing analytics
```typescript
// Events to emit:
// - deep_scan_started { profile, siteId, teamId }
// - page_scanned { url, pageIndex, totalPages }
// - state_tested { state, success, pageUrl }
// - deep_scan_completed { 
//     pagesScanned, 
//     statesAudited, 
//     violations, 
//     advisories, 
//     duration 
//   }
```

### 9. Database Migration
Run the migration:
```bash
cd /Users/ryanhofmann/auditvia
# Apply migration to Supabase (staging first!)
```

### 10. Update Report Page
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/scans/[scanId]/EnterpriseReportClient.tsx`
```tsx
// Add header strip:
// "5 Pages Scanned â€¢ 12 States Tested â€¢ 0 Frames Scanned"

// Add tier filter:
// [All] [Violations Only] [Advisories Only]

// Update issue list to show:
// - Tier badge on each issue
// - Page URL + state context
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Integration Checklist

To get the prototype working end-to-end:

- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Update `/api/audit` to use `runDeepScan`
- [ ] Store enhanced results (new columns + JSONB)
- [ ] Add scan profile selector to Site Settings
- [ ] Show "Pages/States/Violations/Advisories" on Report page
- [ ] Add tier badges to issue list
- [ ] Show "Found on /url â†’ state" in issue details
- [ ] Add telemetry events
- [ ] Test with a real site (should find 2-5x more issues!)

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Impact

### Before (Single Page Scan):
- 1 page scanned
- 1 state tested (default)
- ~10-30 issues found (varies by site)

### After (Deep Scan - Standard Profile):
- 3 pages scanned
- 6 states tested (2 per page)
- ~30-90 issues found (3x increase)
- Clear separation: "45 violations, 15 advisories"

### After (Deep Scan - Deep Profile):
- 5 pages scanned  
- 15 states tested (3 per page)
- ~50-150 issues found (5x increase)
- More comprehensive coverage

## ðŸ”’ Guardrails (Built In)

âœ… Same-origin only (no cross-site crawling)  
âœ… Time budget per site (timeout on page load)  
âœ… Rate limiting (500ms between pages in crawler)  
âœ… Graceful degradation (continues if state fails)  
âœ… Soft fails (skips pages that error)  
âœ… No overlays or DOM injection  
âœ… Clear violation vs advisory separation  

---

## ðŸ’¬ Messaging (Ready to Ship)

### In Settings:
```
Choose your scan depth:
- Quick: Scans homepage only (fastest)
- Standard: Scans top 3 pages with common interactions
- Deep: Comprehensive scan of 5 pages across multiple states

Deep scans find 3-5x more issues by testing menus, modals, and 
multiple pages. Only WCAG violations affect your compliance score.
```

### On Report:
```
ðŸ’¡ Your scan found 45 violations and 15 advisories.

Violations are definitive WCAG failures that affect compliance.
Advisories are best-practice recommendations for manual review.

Some scanners count advisories as "errors" - that's why our 
numbers may look different. We separate them for transparency.
```

## ðŸš€ Next Actions

**Option 1: Complete the prototype** (recommended)
1. Integrate API (1-2 hours)
2. Add UI components (3-4 hours)
3. Test on real sites (1 hour)
4. Ship to staging!

**Option 2: Test the scanner directly**
```bash
cd /Users/ryanhofmann/auditvia
npx tsx scripts/runDeepScan.ts
```

**Option 3: Review and adjust**
- Change page limits
- Add more state interactions
- Refine tier classifications
- Add more WCAG rules
