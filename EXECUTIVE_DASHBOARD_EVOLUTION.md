**Example:**
> "Compliance score increased 4.2 points in 30 days. Violations remediated: 24 (-30.0%). Trajectory indicates continued positive momentum."

---

## 📊 **Data Sources**

### **API Endpoints Used**

1. **`/api/reports/kpis`** - KPIData
   - avg_score_30d (current compliance score)
   - total_violations_30d
   - total_sites
   - total_scans_30d

2. **`/api/reports/trend`** - TrendDataPoint[]
   - Daily violation counts by severity
   - Used for calculating remediation velocity

### **Calculations**

**Score Improvement:**
```typescript
scoreImprovement = currentScore - previousScore
// previousScore baseline: 70% (would come from historical data)
```

**Remediation Velocity:**
```typescript
violationsReduced = previousViolations - currentViolations
weeklyFixRate = violationsReduced / 4.3 // ~4.3 weeks in 30 days
```

**Days to Compliance:**
```typescript
daysToCompliance = (currentViolations / weeklyFixRate) * 7
// Linear projection based on current pace
```

**Industry Percentile:**
```typescript
percentile = currentScore >= industryAvg 
  ? ((currentScore - industryAvg) / (topPerformer - industryAvg)) * 90 + 10
  : (currentScore / industryAvg) * 50
```

**Risk Assessment:**
```typescript
estimatedExposure = totalViolations * 5000 // $5k per violation
riskLevel = criticalCount === 0 ? 'Low' : 
            criticalCount < 5 ? 'Moderate' : 
            'High'
```

---

## 🏆 **Industry Benchmarks**

### **Mock Data (Current)**

- **Industry Average:** 78% compliance
- **Top Performer:** 95% compliance
- **ADA Average Settlement:** $50,000
- **Settlement Range:** $10,000 - $250,000

### **Future Enhancement**

Would come from **aggregated industry data**:

```sql
SELECT 
  AVG(avg_score_30d) as industry_avg,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY avg_score_30d) as top_performer
FROM kpis_view
WHERE industry = 'e-commerce' -- or user's industry
```

---

## 📈 **Forecasting Logic**

### **Linear Projection**

```typescript
// Calculate weekly fix rate from 30-day trend
const violationsReduced = previousViolations - currentViolations
const weeklyFixRate = violationsReduced / 4.3

// Project days to zero violations
const daysToCompliance = (currentViolations / weeklyFixRate) * 7
```

**Assumptions:**
- Constant remediation velocity
- No new violations introduced
- Linear trend continues

**Caveats (shown in narrative):**
> "This assumes you maintain your current pace of fixes. Accelerating your efforts could reduce this timeline, while slowing down would extend it."

---

## 🎯 **ADA Lawsuit Data**

### **Research-Based Metrics**

**2023 ADA Digital Accessibility Lawsuits:**
- Average settlement: ~$50,000
- Range: $10,000 to $250,000+
- Median: ~$50,000
- Legal fees: Often additional $20k-$100k

**Risk Factors:**
- **Critical violations (WCAG Level A):** High risk
- **No critical violations:** Low risk
- **Proactive compliance:** Minimal risk

---

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### **Phase 1: Real Industry Data**

```sql
-- Aggregate anonymous compliance data
CREATE VIEW industry_benchmarks AS
SELECT 
  industry_type,
  AVG(avg_score_30d) as industry_avg,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY avg_score_30d) as top_performer,
  COUNT(*) as sample_size
FROM kpis_view
GROUP BY industry_type
```

**Result:** Real industry averages instead of mock data

---

### **Phase 2: Predictive AI**

Replace linear projections with ML-based forecasts:

```typescript
// Train model on historical remediation patterns
const forecast = await predictCompliance({
  historicalData: last90Days,
  teamSize: 3,
  scanFrequency: 'weekly',
  autoFixEnabled: true
})

// Returns: { daysToCompliance: 42, confidence: 0.85 }
```

**Benefits:**
- More accurate predictions
- Accounts for team capacity
- Considers auto-fix usage
