### Step 1: Hard Refresh Your Browser ⚡
```
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

```

### Step 2: Test These Pages 🧪

1. **Go to `/dashboard`**:
   - ✅ Should be light theme (not dark)
   - ✅ Should show "Compliance Status" with verdict pill
   - ✅ No console errors

2. **Go to `/dashboard/analytics`**:

   - ✅ Banner changes based on violation counts

4. **Go to `/dashboard/sites`**:

   - 🔍 Report what happens!

5. **Go to a completed scan report**:

   - ✅ AI Engineer widget should open if ❌/⚠️

## Debug the "View Scans" Issue 🔍

### Check 1: Console Log
In browser console when on `/dashboard/sites`, look for:
```
🏠 [SitesPage] teamId: abc-123-xyz
```

**Report back**:
- Is `teamId` null or a UUID?
- Is `teamLoading` true or false?

### Check 2: Link HTML
Right-click "View Scans" button → Inspect Element

**Report back**:
- Does `href` include `?teamId=...`?
- What's the full href value?

### Check 3: Network Request
Open Network tab → Click "View Scans"

**Report back**:
- What URL is requested?
- What's the status code? (404, 302, etc.)

## If Everything Works:

🎉 **Celebrate!** Then test these scenarios:

### Happy Path Testing:
1. Run a new scan → Watch animated modal
2. Click through to report → Verify verdict banner
3. Expand category → Check human impact tooltip
4. Toggle Founder/Dev mode → Verify it persists
5. Navigate through analytics → Verify verdict displays

### Edge Case Testing:
1. Site with 0 violations → Should show ✅ Compliant
2. Site with 1-2 serious → Should show ⚠️ At Risk
3. Site with ≥1 critical → Should show ❌ Non-Compliant
