## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration ✅ REQUIRED

The migration creates all 10 views and indexes. **This must be done before deploying the app.**

**Option A: Via Supabase CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /path/to/auditvia
npx supabase db push
```

**Option B: Via Supabase Dashboard (If CLI fails)**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql/new
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/0060_create_report_views.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify success: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM report_kpis_view;`

### Step 2: Verify Migration ✅

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm views are working:

```sql
-- Should return 1 row with your team's KPIs
SELECT * FROM report_kpis_view LIMIT 1;

-- Should return daily trends (if you have scans)
SELECT * FROM violations_trend_view ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Should return your top rules
SELECT * FROM top_rules_view ORDER BY violation_count DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application ✅

The app code is ready. Deploy as usual:

**Vercel:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**Self-hosted:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Step 4: Smoke Test ✅

After deployment:

1. **Navigate to `/dashboard/reports`**
   - Verify KPI cards show real numbers (not mock data)
   - Check that charts render without errors
   - Confirm filters update the data

2. **Test filters:**
   - Change time range → all widgets should update
   - Select a specific site → data should filter
   - Change severity → trend chart should filter

3. **Test exports:**
   - Click "Export CSV" on any widget
   - Verify CSV downloads with correct data

4. **Test drilldowns:**
   - Click "View all X rules" link
   - Verify table renders and is sortable
   - Same for pages drilldown

5. **Test URL sharing:**
   - Apply filters
   - Copy URL
   - Open in new tab/incognito
   - Verify filters are preserved

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables required! The dashboard uses existing auth and database config.

**Required (already set):**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

### Feature Flags

None required. The dashboard is always enabled for authenticated users.

---

## 📊 Data Requirements

### Minimum Data for Meaningful Dashboard

The dashboard works with any amount of data, but for best results:

- **At least 1 completed scan** in the last 30 days
- **At least 1 site** with monitoring enabled
- **Historical data** (7+ days) for trend charts

### If You Have No Data

The dashboard handles empty states gracefully:
- KPI cards show `0` values
- Charts display "No data available" messages
- Tables show "No results found"

### Generating Test Data

If you need sample data for demo purposes, run a few scans:

```bash
# Via UI: Add a site and click "Run Scan"
# Via API:
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/audit \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","name":"Example Site"}'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch data"

**Cause:** Views not created or permissions missing

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Verify views exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_views WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename LIKE 'report%';

-- Should return 10 rows
-- If not, re-run migration
```

### Issue: KPI cards show 0 despite having scans

**Cause:** Scans not in `completed` status or older than 30 days

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check scan status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM scans GROUP BY status;

-- Check scan dates
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scans WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

Adjust time range filter to include older scans.

### Issue: Charts not rendering

**Cause:** JavaScript error or missing data

**Fix:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Verify API endpoints return 200 status

### Issue: Filters don't update data

**Cause:** URL state not syncing or React re-render issue

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check console for React warnings

## 🚀 Performance

### Expected Load Times

| Page | First Load | Filter Change |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Main dashboard | < 2s | < 500ms |
| Rules drilldown | < 1s | < 300ms |
| Pages drilldown | < 1s | < 300ms |

### Optimization Tips

1. **Database:**
   - Views are pre-indexed for common queries
   - No additional indexes needed for MVP

2. **API:**
   - Responses are streamed (no artificial delays)
   - Parallel fetching minimizes total load time

3. **Frontend:**
   - React hooks memoize data
   - Widgets load independently (no blocking)

---

## 🔒 Security

### Access Control

✅ **Enforced:**
- User must be authenticated
- User must be team member
- All queries scoped to user's team

✅ **Tested:**
- Cannot access other team's data
- Cannot bypass team scoping via URL manipulation

### Data Privacy

✅ **No PII in logs**
✅ **No secrets exposed to client**
✅ **API tokens server-side only**

---

## 📈 Analytics

The dashboard emits analytics events for:

- `reports_dashboard_viewed` - When dashboard loads
- `reports_filters_changed` - When user changes filters
- `reports_export` - When user exports CSV

Events include:
- `teamId` (hashed)
- `timeRange`
- `siteId` (if filtered)
- `severity` (if filtered)
- `widget` (for exports)

**No sensitive data is tracked.**

---

## 🎨 Design System

The dashboard follows the existing Auditvia design system:

- **Colors:** Gray-900 background, gray-800 cards, blue accents
- **Typography:** System font stack, consistent sizing
- **Spacing:** 4px grid (Tailwind defaults)
- **Borders:** Gray-700 for cards, subtle hover states

**No new components or patterns introduced** - everything reuses existing UI primitives.

## 📞 Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I customize the risk dollar values?**  
A: Yes! Edit `risk_reduced_view` in migration file and change severity weights.

**Q: How often should I run scans for meaningful trends?**  
A: Daily or weekly. More frequent = better trend data.

**Q: Can I export the entire dashboard?**  
A: CSV exports work per-widget. PDF export is planned for future.

**Q: Do filters affect GitHub issue creation?**  
A: No. Filters are read-only and don't affect any write operations.
