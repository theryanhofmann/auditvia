# Verdict Rollout Status - October 1, 2025

## üéâ Major Milestone: 3/7 Core Tasks Complete (43%)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Overview Dashboard ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/app/components/dashboard/OverviewDashboard.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- Replaced "Compliance Score" KPI with "Compliance Status" verdict pill
- Added severity breakdown pills (Critical/Serious counts)
- Verdict calculation from real-time data
- Color-coded gradients (green/amber/red based on verdict)
- Removed old score utility functions

**Impact**: Users see "‚úÖ Compliant" instead of "Score 94%" on main dashboard

---

### Task 2: Scan History Tables ‚úÖ
**Files**: 
- `src/app/api/sites/[siteId]/scans/route.ts` (API)
- `src/app/dashboard/sites/[siteId]/history/ScanHistoryClient.tsx` (UI)

**What Changed**:
- API now returns severity breakdown for each scan
- Table column changed from "Score" to "Compliance"
- Verdict pills with icons (‚úÖ Compliant / ‚ö†Ô∏è At Risk / ‚ùå Non-Compliant)
- Severity badges below verdicts (e.g., "2 Critical, 5 Serious")
- All score-based functions replaced with verdict-based

**Impact**: All scan history displays actionable verdicts with severity context

---

### Task 3: Analytics Dashboard ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/analytics/AnalyticsClient.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- Replaced "Avg Compliance Score" KPI with "Compliance Status"
- New KPI shows: "12 Compliant" with "3 At Risk, 1 Non-Compliant" subtitle
- Updated trend logic to use compliance-status KPI ID
- Completely rewrote SitesPerformanceModule:
  - **Before**: Scatter chart with X=score (0-100)
  - **After**: 3-card grid showing verdict distribution with issue counts
- Module title changed from "Sites by Score & Trend" to "Sites by Verdict"
- Added subtitle support to KPI interface

**Impact**: Analytics now shows clear compliance status instead of abstract scores

## üìä Progress Summary

### What Works Now:
1. **Overview Dashboard**: Shows verdict pill with severity breakdown
2. **Scan History**: All history tables display verdicts
3. **Analytics**: Compliance status KPI and verdict distribution
4. **Report Details**: EnterpriseReportClient uses verdicts (from prior work)
5. **Scan Modal**: AnimatedScanModal shows verdict on completion (from prior work)
6. **Telemetry**: Fixed double events, added report_viewed_v2 (from prior work)

### Where Scores Still Appear:
‚ùå None in the primary UI flows we've updated so far!

## ‚è≥ Remaining Tasks (4/7)

### Task 4: Violations Page
**Files to Update**:
- `src/app/dashboard/violations/ViolationsClient.tsx`

**What Needs to Change**:
- Add global verdict chip at top of violations list
- Show "Overall: ‚ö†Ô∏è At Risk" for the filtered period
- Keep violation counts, add verdict context
- Calculate verdict from aggregated severity counts in current filter

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Task 5: Light Theme & Enterprise Styling
**Files to Update**:
- All report pages (`src/app/dashboard/reports/**`)
- Main layout components

**What Needs to Change**:
- Force light theme across all report pages
- Update buttons to Stripe/Vercel style:
  - Subtle borders instead of heavy shadows
  - Consistent sizing (px-4 py-2 standard)
  - Hover states with border color changes
- Update spacing (use 4px grid consistently)
- Ensure Founder/Developer mode persists across navigation

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### Task 6: Notifications
**Files to Update**:
- Notification templates
- Email templates (if any)

**What Needs to Change**:
- Titles use verdict language: "Site moved to At Risk" instead of "Score dropped to 75%"
- Body includes severity breakdown
- Use verdict colors for notification styling

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Task 7: Final Integration Check
**Comprehensive Testing**:
- [ ] No page shows percent score text
- [ ] Every report shows verdict banner
- [ ] Category grouping appears in all reports
- [ ] Founder/Dev toggle works everywhere
- [ ] AI widget auto-opens for ‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è verdicts
- [ ] Tooltips for Inapplicable and Needs Review appear
- [ ] "Email to Designer" flow works
- [ ] Single `scan_completed` event with valid `siteId`
- [ ] All enterprise components render on completed report route

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

## üéØ API Requirements for Full Functionality

### Already Working:
- `calculateVerdict()` from `verdict-system.ts`
- Issue categorization
- Severity breakdown from issues

### Need API Updates:

#### 1. `/api/analytics/kpis` should return:
```typescript
{
  compliantSites: { value: number, delta: number, sparklineData: number[] },
  atRiskSites: { value: number },
  nonCompliantSites: { value: number },
  // ... existing KPIs
}
```

#### 2. `/api/analytics/sites-performance` should return:
```typescript
[{
  siteId: string,
  siteName: string,
  verdict: 'compliant' | 'at-risk' | 'non-compliant',
  issueCount: number
}]
```

## üí° User Experience Improvements

### Before Verdict Rollout:
- "Your site scored 87%" - What does this mean? Is it good?
- "Score dropped from 92% to 87%" - Is this critical?
- Scatter charts with X=score - Too abstract for decision-making

### After Verdict Rollout:
- "‚úÖ Compliant" - Clear status at a glance
- "‚ö†Ô∏è At Risk: 2 Critical, 5 Serious issues" - Actionable info
- "3 sites Non-Compliant" - Clear prioritization

---

## üöÄ Next Actions

**Immediate** (to get to 70% complete):
1. Update Violations page with global verdict chip (30 min)
2. Apply light theme to report pages (1 hour)

**Then** (to get to 100%):
3. Update notifications to use verdict language (30 min)
4. Run comprehensive integration tests (1 hour)

**Total remaining**: ~3 hours to complete full rollout
