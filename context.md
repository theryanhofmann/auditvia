# Context: Auditvia

Auditvia is a sleek, modern web app that helps developers and teams audit their websites for accessibility (ADA / WCAG compliance). The product scans URLs, detects accessibility issues, and provides actionable insights and progress tracking.

## Core Features

- **Comprehensive WCAG Audits**  
  Scans based on WCAG 2.2 and ADA compliance standards. Outputs are detailed and developer-friendly.

- **Progress Tracking**  
  Users can view scan history, score improvements, and issue trends over time.

- **Automated Monitoring**  
  Background scan scheduling and alerting for regressions or new issues.

- **Scan Reports**  
  Developer-oriented reports with real HTML snippets, fix recommendations, and scoring.

## Design System & Tone

- Built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and modern best practices.
- Uses a **dark, cinematic, clean interface**. Think GitHub dark mode meets Vercel.
- Icons and typography should be clear, accessible, and minimal.
- No bloat, no animations unless meaningful — clarity and function first.

## UI Goals

- Modular, responsive layouts that scale across devices.
- Navigation should be either a fixed sidebar or a topbar with clean Tailwind utility classes.
- All pages should use semantic HTML (headings, sections, etc.) with `prose` typography where appropriate.

## Target Users

- Frontend developers
- CTOs and engineering teams
- Agencies and compliance auditors

## Brand Voice

- Professional but not corporate
- Clear, concise, and developer-friendly
- No fluff, no jargon — accessibility is for everyone

## What to avoid

- Overstyled elements or bloated layout wrappers
- Tailwind misuse (e.g., repetitive utility overload)
- Accessibility violations (e.g., poor contrast, missing alt text, no focus states)
