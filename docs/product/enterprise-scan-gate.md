## Problem Statement

### Current Behavior

Auditvia currently scans entire websites without budget limits, leading to:

1. **SMB sites (5-50 pages)** - Complete quickly, good UX ‚úÖ
2. **Mid-size sites (50-150 pages)** - Slow but acceptable (5-10 min) ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **Enterprise sites (150+ pages)** - Extremely slow or timeout (15-60+ min) ‚ùå

**Issues**:
- Users abandon scans on large sites (poor conversion)
- Server costs spike on enterprise sites
- No differentiation between Free/Pro/Enterprise tiers
- No upsell mechanism for enterprise users

### Goal

Implement **smart scan gating** that:
- ‚úÖ SMB sites ‚Üí Fast, complete scans (retain current UX)
- ‚úÖ Mid-size sites ‚Üí Intelligent sampling (5-10 min max)
- ‚úÖ Enterprise sites ‚Üí Early detection + upgrade prompt (30s-2min detection)
- ‚úÖ Enterprise tier ‚Üí Full deep scans with resumability

---

## Scan Profiles

### QUICK Profile (Default for Free/Pro <50 pages)

```typescript
{
  maxUrls: 50,
  maxDuration: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  strategy: 'complete',
  sitemapFirst: true,
  priorityOrder: ['homepage', 'navigation', 'discovered']
}
```

**Triggers**:
- Site has sitemap with <50 URLs
- Manual selection by user (future)

**Behavior**:
- Crawl all pages exhaustively
- No sampling needed
- Fast turnaround

---

### SMART Profile (Default for Pro 50-150 pages)

```typescript
{
  maxUrls: 150,
  maxDuration: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
  strategy: 'priority-sampling',
  sitemapFirst: true,
  priorityOrder: ['homepage', 'product', 'navigation', 'content'],
  enterpriseDetectionThreshold: 150
}
```

**Triggers**:
- Site sitemap has 50-150 URLs
- Crawl discovers 50-150 pages
- Default for Pro tier

**Behavior**:
- Crawl sitemap first (if available)
- Prioritize high-value pages:
  1. Homepage
  2. Product/service pages
  3. Main navigation links
  4. Sample of content pages
- Stop at 150 URLs or 10 min
- Show coverage summary

**Enterprise Detection**:
Triggers upgrade prompt if:
- `discoveredUrls > 150` OR
- `elapsed > 5min AND frontierStillGrowing`

---

### DEEP Profile (Enterprise Tier Only)

```typescript
{
  maxUrls: 1000,
  maxDuration: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
  strategy: 'comprehensive',
  sitemapFirst: true,
  priorityOrder: ['homepage', 'product', 'navigation', 'content', 'utility'],
  resumable: true, // Future
  checkpointInterval: 100 // Future
}
```

**Triggers**:
- User has Enterprise entitlement
- Manual selection for Enterprise users

**Behavior**:
- Full sitemap crawl
- Priority queue for discovered URLs
- Comprehensive coverage
- Future: Checkpoint every 100 URLs for resumability

---

## Enterprise Detection Logic

### Triggers

Enterprise site detected when **ANY** of:

1. **URL Discovery**:
   - `discoveredUrls > 150` during crawl

2. **Time + Growth**:
   - `elapsedTime > 5min` AND
   - `frontier.size > 50` (still discovering new URLs)

3. **Sitemap Size**:
   - Sitemap contains `> 150` URLs

### Detection Flow

```
Start Scan
  ‚Üì
Load Sitemap (if available)
  ‚Üì
sitemap.urls > 150?
  YES ‚Üí Mark as Enterprise Site
  NO ‚Üí Continue crawl
  ‚Üì
While crawling:
  ‚îú‚îÄ discoveredUrls > 150? ‚Üí Mark as Enterprise
  ‚îî‚îÄ elapsed > 5min AND frontier > 50? ‚Üí Mark as Enterprise
  ‚Üì
If Enterprise Detected:
  ‚îú‚îÄ User has Enterprise tier? ‚Üí Continue DEEP scan
  ‚îî‚îÄ User on Free/Pro? ‚Üí Stop scan, show upgrade prompt
```

---

## UX Copy

### Enterprise Detection Modal

**Title**: üè¢ **Enterprise Site Detected**

**Body**:
> We've detected this is a large, complex website with **{estimatedPages}+ pages**.
>
> Your current scan stopped at **{scannedPages} pages** to respect your plan limits.
>
> **What you're seeing**:
> - ‚úÖ Complete analysis of your top **{scannedPages}** priority pages
> - üìä Sample coverage: **~{coveragePercent}%** of total site
>
> **Upgrade to Enterprise** for:
> - üîç Full deep scans (up to 1,000 pages)
> - üéØ Complete site coverage with intelligent prioritization
> - üîÑ Resumable scans for maximum reliability
> - üìà Advanced compliance forecasting

**CTAs**:
- Primary: "Upgrade to Enterprise" (links to billing)
- Secondary: "View Sample Report" (closes modal, shows partial results)
- Tertiary: "Learn More" (links to pricing page)

### Coverage Summary (In Report)

**Location**: Top of scan report, info banner

**QUICK Profile (Complete Coverage)**:
```
‚úÖ Complete Scan
Analyzed all 42 pages on your site.
```

**SMART Profile (Partial Coverage)**:
```
üìä Smart Scan - Priority Sampling
Analyzed 150 of ~250 estimated pages (60% coverage)
‚Ä¢ All high-priority pages scanned (homepage, products, navigation)
‚Ä¢ Sample of content pages included
‚Ä¢ Upgrade to Enterprise for 100% coverage
```

**DEEP Profile (Enterprise)**:
```
üè¢ Enterprise Deep Scan

### Sample Report Behavior

When enterprise detection stops scan early:

**What User Sees**:
1. **Enterprise detection modal** (see copy above)
2. **Partial scan report** with coverage banner
3. **Top 20-50 pages** ranked by priority:
   - Homepage (always included)
   - Product/service pages (from nav)
   - Main navigation links
   - High-priority content pages

**What User Does NOT See**:
- ‚ùå Low-priority content pages
- ‚ùå Utility pages (privacy, terms, etc.)
- ‚ùå Deep-nested pages beyond priority threshold

**Report Features**:
- ‚úÖ Issue counts (for scanned pages only)
- ‚úÖ Compliance score (with caveat: "based on sample")
- ‚úÖ Category breakdown
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Prominent banner: "This is a sample report. Upgrade for complete analysis."
