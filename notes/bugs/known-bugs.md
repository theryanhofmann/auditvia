Very technical, enterprise focused

Not SMB-friendly

Complex onboarding and pricing

Design Principles

✅ Truth-First UI

Never fake a score. Always show real data, even if it's not perfect.

⭐ Clean Is Credible

Fast, dark, minimal UI helps users trust what's shown.

⚙ Built for Builders

Developers and founders are our users. We meet them with actionable insight, not legalese.

⏳ Speed + Clarity

Scans should feel fast. Results should be clear. Time-to-value is critical.

🔓 Transparent Logic

We never obfuscate how something works. Explain the source, standard, and what to do.
