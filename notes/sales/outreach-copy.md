💻 Developer-Focused

"Hey [First Name], noticed you're working on [Project Name]. Most dev teams miss one critical thing: real accessibility scanning. We built Auditvia to give you honest, WCAG-level insights with one click. No overlays, no fluff. Just scans that help you ship safer, more compliant products."

🤝 Founder-Focused

"Hi [Name], we built Auditvia to help founders avoid accessibility lawsuits and win more contracts. You’ll get a compliance badge, PDF exports, and auto-alerts when something breaks. Scan your site, see your risk, and stay ahead—no dev team required."

✏️ Agency-Focused

"Hey [Agency Name], want to win more edu/gov RFPs? Auditvia gives your team the ability to scan client sites, generate WCAG reports, and monitor accessibility without needing full compliance departments. We’d love to show you how."
